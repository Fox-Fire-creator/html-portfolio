<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>
  Hi there! I’m a 13-year-old tech enthusiast with a deep passion for robotics, electronics, programming, and science. 
  Ever since I was 6, I’ve been experimenting with circuits, sensors, and coding—starting with basic projects and 
  eventually building complex systems that solve real-world problems. My journey has been full of curiosity, creativity, 
  and hands-on learning.
</p>

<p>
  I’ve designed and built a wide range of projects including <strong>automatic night lamps, water level indicators, 
  battery level monitors, Bluetooth-controlled robots, gesture-based devices, and smart home systems</strong>. 
  These projects have helped me understand everything from basic electronics and soldering to microcontroller programming, 
  circuit design, and real-time data processing.
</p>

<p>
  At age 10, I discovered my love for programming. Since then, I’ve learned <strong>Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and C</strong>. 
  I use these skills to create clean and responsive websites and to automate tasks with code. Whether it’s a functional front-end 
  web interface or a hardware-software integration with Arduino, I enjoy making things that work—and look—great.
</p>

<p>
  I’m especially interested in how different technologies interact. From coding logic to sensor data collection, 
  I like connecting physical systems with digital solutions. I’ve also explored topics like AI basics, game development, 
  and computer architecture to deepen my understanding of the tech world.
</p>

<p>
  Outside of building and coding, I love research. I often spend hours diving into complex topics across physics, chemistry, 
  and emerging technologies—because I don’t just want to build stuff, I want to understand how and why it works.
</p>

<p>
  I'm also a gamer and video creator. At age 7, I started a YouTube channel where I recorded, edited, and uploaded 
  gaming videos all by myself. It taught me early skills in editing, audio, scripting, and presentation. 
  The channel is still live, and I plan to return to it with tech builds, coding tutorials, and game-related content.
</p>

<p>
  In short, I’m a maker, coder, and curious learner who thrives on experimenting, building, and sharing knowledge. 
  Whether it’s on a breadboard, a code editor, or a blank canvas for an idea—I’m always working on something exciting. 
  I’m open to freelance work, collaborations, and anything that challenges my creativity and helps me grow.
